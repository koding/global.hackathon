We like to code and design. We like to find solutions to a daily problems. And we have the opportunity to deal with the current problems regarding TOC adn fine print in this Hackathon.


About your skills and what you are going to do?
=======

We are a team With a background of coders skills mainly in backend and a strategic planner. We like Restful APIs, Java mainly but we are more than comfortable with new languages. I think this is a great opportunity for not only to challenge ourselves but for testing and improving our skills.

The project we are going to do is to improve the way the websites expose their fine print. As we know this is completely ignore by the user.
